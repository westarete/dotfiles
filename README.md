# Dot Files for West Arete

These are the common dot files that we share across our home directories.

As of yet, there is no fancy installation script; just manually put these in
place, or blend them with what you have now. 

They're named here without the leading dot, so that the repository is easy to
work with. You'll need to rename them e.g. from `gemrc` to `~/.gemrc` when you
install them.
